# Concept

A website where users have credits and actvity is tracked, users can have like 1 million credits and every like, every button they click takes away a few credits, this way people will be careful while browsing and scrolling and not mindlessly scroll. Credits refill every week or day but once a user runs out of credit before the given time they are unable to use the app further for that period of time.
